# EDA_AirBNB
Through its online marketplace, Airbnb connects visitors with hosts in their area. 
One benefit of the platform is that it allows users to market their available space and generate extra revenue through rent. 
On the other hand, Airbnb gives visitors the opportunity to reserve distinctive homestays from neighbourhood hosts, saving them money and allowing them to mingle with the community. 
Airbnb is a global brand with operations in more than 190 nations that serve the on-demand travel market.
Finding the factors that affect real estate listings on the site is the goal. 
I'll investigate and visualise the dataset from Airbnb in NYC using simple exploratory data analysis (EDA) approaches. 
Based on each listing's location, price, room type, and other pertinent characteristics, I will determine how frequently it appears on Airbnb. 
I looked at this data from a number of angles and discovered some intriguing results. 
The marketing, financial, and technical departments at Airbnb may use this to make smart, data-driven decisions.
